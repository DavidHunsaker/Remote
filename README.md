# Remote

I had used many universal remote apps and was annoyed with all of the ads that made them near-impossible to use.
This project started with my current Sony XBR TV, but I was asked to expand it to include LG TVs. 

I would like to expand this further and here are a few of the planned updates:
* Refactor Hex Codes to be stored in XML
* Add Smart TV Functionality utilizing wi-fi
* Menu to select a main remote
* Add functionality for:
  * Vizio
  * Sharp
  * Samsung
  * Panasonic
  * TCL
  * Insignia
* Contact form to ask for a specific TV
